# Health-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes data from 100 adults to explore relationships between mental health, physical health, BMI, gender, and exercise habits using descriptive statistics and statistical testing to uncover patterns and associations among key health indicators.

## Project Description

This project explores the relationship between mental health, physical health, gender, BMI, and exercise habits in adults. A researcher surveyed 100 adults and collected the following data:
- Height (m)
- Weight (kg)
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Mental Health Score (MH): Higher scores indicate more severe mental health issues
- Physical Health Score (VO2Max, in ml/kg/min): Higher scores indicate better physical health
- Regular Exercise Participation (Yes/No)

The primary aim of this analysis is to apply descriptive and inferential statistical methods to address the following research questions:

1. Is there a difference in Mental Health Score and Physical Health Score between males and females?
2. Is there a difference in Mental Health Score and Physical Health Score across different BMI groups (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)?
3. Is there a relationship between Mental Health and Physical Health scores?
4. Is there a relationship between BMI (as a continuous variable) and Physical Health Score?
5. Is there an association between Regular Exercise and Gender?
6. Is there an association between Regular Exercise and BMI group?

Each question will be addressed using appropriate statistical techniques, supported by visualisations, summary tables  and interpretation.
